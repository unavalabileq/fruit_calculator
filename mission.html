    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>
      We believe that fruit storage and ripeness prediction shouldn't be a guessing game. Our mission is to bring science and technology together to empower consumers, farmers, and sellers with reliable, easy-to-use tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      By combining extensive research data with modern web technology, we strive to minimize food waste, maximize freshness, and improve everyone's experience with fruit â€” from orchard to table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Innovation and education are at the core of what we do. We want to inspire better choices for healthier living and a more sustainable planet, one fruit at a time.
